A 5-transistor operational transconductance amplifier is designed by taking a constant reference current source of 12.5uA. The design specifications are 20MHz unity-gain bandwidth (UGB) and 40db gain. The lengths of both NMOS and PMOS are taken to be 180nm. The widths of the mosfets are calculated from relation of transconductance gm with current (I) and relation of gm with gain (A).
